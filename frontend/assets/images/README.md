<!-- This is a placeholder file to represent where product images would be stored -->
<!-- In a real application, you would store actual image files here -->
<!-- For now, we'll use a default image or CSS styling for product placeholders -->

<!-- You can replace this with actual product images or use a service like Lorem Picsum -->
<!-- Example: https://picsum.photos/300/200 for random images -->

This directory will contain product images.
